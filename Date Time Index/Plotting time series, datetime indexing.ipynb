Your job is to convert the 'Date' column from a collection of strings into a collection of datetime objects. Then, you will use this converted 'Date' column as your new index, and re-plot the data, noting the improved datetime awareness. After you are done, you can cycle between the two plots you generated by clicking on the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons.\n",
