    "In this exercise, you'll investigate the probabilities of life expectancy in countries around the world. This dataset contains life expectancy for persons born each year from 1800 to 2015. Since country names change or results are not reported, not every country has values. This dataset was obtained from Gapminder.\n",

    "First, you will determine the number of countries reported in 2015. There are a total of 260 unique countries in the entire dataset. Then, you will compute the 5th and 95th percentiles of life expectancy over the entire dataset. Finally, you will make a box plot of life expectancy every 50 years from 1800 to 2000. Notice the large change in the distributions over this period.\n",
